üéóÔ∏è **Just the UI**

Houx is designed to be focused on the view layer, making it easy to integrate with other backend logic or state management libraries, such as Redux or GraphQL, without any fuss.

üì≤ **Virtual DOM**

Houx is optimized for performance and scalability, with a virtual DOM that minimizes DOM mutations and smart updates that only update components when necessary. This means your application will be fast and responsive, even with complex and dynamic user interfaces.

‚öõÔ∏è **JSX**
 
 Enjoy the freedom of JSX support, allowing you to choose the rendering style that best suits your project's needs and your personal coding preferences.

üí´ **TypeScript Support**

Out-of-the-box TypeScript support optimizes the development process and enhances debugging, making Houx the ideal choice for modern, large-scale projects.





üí™ **Getting Started**

Whether you're starting fresh or integrating into an existing project, Houx makes it easy to get up and running. For a full-fledged experience, we recommend using the official scaffolding tool, **HouxKit**.

Install HouxKit via npm:

```bash
npm install init:houx
```

For simpler integration, Houx can be added directly to your project with:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hexaxsoftwares/houx.js@main/houx.global.dev.js"></script>
```
Check the Installation guide for detailed Installation information.

##### Basic Usage

Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Houx.js Example</title>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hexaxsoftwares/houx.js@main/houx.global.dev.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  </div>

  <script>
    Houx.initBuild({
      model:function(){
        this.message= 'Hello, Houx.js!'
      }
    }).mount('#app');
    //You will have to call the .mount(selector or DOM node) to get rendered to the DOM
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This example demonstrates how to create a basic Houx instance and bind data to the DOM.

##### Widgets

Widgets are reusable pieces of your UI. Define an initial entrypoint widget build by calling the `Houx.initBuild()` method: and then registering other child widgets with the `initBuild.widget()` call.

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  model:function(){
    this.message= 'Hello, Houx.js!'
  }
}).widget('my-widget', {
  template: '<div>A custom widget!</div>'
}).mount('#app');
```

Use your widget in the DOM within the mount root:

```html
<my-widget></my-widget>
```

##### Reactivity System

Houx uses a reactive data system to update the DOM when your data changes. When you modify the data, the framework automatically re-renders the affected parts of the UI.  
Here is a simple counter app that updates a count once the button updates the counter prop through an inline event listener.
```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  model:function(){
    this.count = 0
  }
}).mount('#app')
```
Usage in templates
```html
<!--in Dom templates-->
<div id='app'>
  <button $$on:click='count++' > I'm clicked {{ count }} times </button>
</div>
```

##### Directives

Directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element or widget instance. Common directives include:

- `$$bind`: Bind a value to an element's attribute.
- `$$on`: Attach an event listener to an element.

Example:

```html
<button $$on:click="increment">Click me</button>
```
> Directives are denoted by prepending a double dollar sign (`$$`) to an attribue.

## Event Handling

Houx makes it easy to handle user events. Define methods in your widget and use the `$$on` directive to attach it to an actual houx element vnode:

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  model:function(){
    this.count= 0
  },
  handlers: {
    increment() {
      this.count++;
    }
  }
}).mount('#app);
```
Usage in template
```html
<button $$on:click="increment">Click me</button>
```

##### Data Binding

Houx supports both one-way and two-way data binding. Use the `$$model` directive for two-way data binding with form elements:

```html
<input $$model="message">
```

## Lifecycle Hooks

Houx provides several lifecycle hooks that allow you to run code at specific stages of a widget's life:

- `postBuild`: Called after the instance and vnodes are created.
- `onWatch`:Called when effect watch is installed
- `postMount`: Called after the instance is mounted.
- `onEffect`:Called once a reactive effect is triggered.
- `postUpdate`: Called after the instance's data is updated.
- `postDestroy`: Called after the instance is destroyed.
- etc....

Example:

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  model:function() {
    this.message= 'Hello!'
  },
  postBuild:function() {
    console.log('Instance created!');
  }
});
```
This merely scratches the surface, contact the lifecycle hooks API fore more hooks.

#### Advanced Topics

##### Custom Directives

You can create custom directives to encapsulate reusable behavior:

```javascript
Houx.initBuild({
  //widget options
}).directive('focus', {
  created:function(vnode, value, modifiers ) {
    el.$element.focus();
  }
});
// registered using the initBuild().directive() call
```
To be used the same way with builtin Directives

##### Plugins

Extend Houx functionality with plugins. A plugin is a function that adds an app level functionality to your build:

```javascript

Houx.initBuild({
  //options
}).install({
  plugin:function(build, options){
    
  }
}, {
  //plugin options
});
```
